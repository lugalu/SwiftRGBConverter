# SwiftRGBConverter
RGB converter made in swift, this is a project like my other color converter [colorConverter repo](https://github.com/lugalu/RGBConverter),

## Conversion
* RGB 255
* RGB 1
* HEX
* CMYK

## Features
* Pick Color from images
* Easy to use interface


## Planned Updates
* This project is abandoned since 09 of january of 2022
The reason behind this is I lost interest in this project since I started it during my early Swift study
this is a great project to learn in and outs of Swift, but due to the fact it doesn't follow any architecture or pattern 
would have to rewrite it just to be able to understand what's going on, I think it still is a great resource for some of
the maths behind color conversion so I will be letting this for anyone who needs a few pointers in this direction.

Maybe in the future I will regain interest in this and finish the project.

## What would need to be done
* Finish core Data integration
* Finish the screen with all the colors relationships: Analogous, complementary...
* Add an API layer to get the color name from a database something like [The ColorAPI](https://www.thecolorapi.com/)
* Quality of life: clicking anywhere to close keyboard, better explaning of the range limits of the colors, and other small things.

## Bug fixes
* The analogous views are getting transparent.
